A web app built with a flow of Register → Login → Profile. User credentials are securely stored in MySQL, while profile details like age, DOB, and contact are managed in MongoDB. Sessions are handled using Redis tokens with browser localStorage. The frontend is styled with Bootstrap and fully interacts through jQuery AJAX without form submissions.
