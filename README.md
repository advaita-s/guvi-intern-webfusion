# GUVI Intern Web App

A web application built with a flow of Register → Login → Profile.

  1. User credentials are securely stored in MySQL.
  2. Profile details such as age, DOB, and contact are managed in MongoDB.
  3. Sessions are handled using Redis tokens with browser localStorage.
  4. The frontend is styled with Bootstrap and uses jQuery AJAX for smooth interaction (no form submissions).
